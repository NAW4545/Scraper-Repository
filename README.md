## Usage

Usage
As the SLO Manager is only designed for use at Butte College, the user base and application for the software is narrow.

User Base
The user base will consist mainly of department chairs and the PLO Coordinator.

Expected Output
SLO Manager should scrape SLO and PLO data from the Butte College Website and store it in the MySQL database with metadata for name, department, program, and semester. Should store discussions in the database with metadata for data, departments, and programs discussed. SLO Manager should show which PLOs must be evaluated each semester, grouped by department. 

Test Plans
After completion of the installation guide above, all the <a href="https://github.com/NAW4545/Scraper-Repository/blob/main/documentation/test-plans">test plans</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/NAW4545/Scraper-Repository/blob/main/documentation">documentation</a> folder should pass.
